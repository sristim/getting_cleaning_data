#Data Source

## Original data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
## Original description of the dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

#Please go through README.txt file. It contains description of experiment, files in dataset.

##Steps to get and clean data and find the average in run_analysis.R

### 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
### 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# How run_analysis.R implements the above steps:

### 1) Require reshape2 and data.table libraries
### 2) Load both test and train data set
### 3) Load the features and activity labels
### 4) Extract only mean and standard deviation column names and data
### 5) Process the data. There are two parts processing test and train data respectively
### 6) Merge data set
### 7) Find the average
### 8) Write the data in a txt file
